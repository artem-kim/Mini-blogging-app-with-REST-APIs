# REST-API-project

This is a guided project from realpython.com.

The project is a mini-blogging web application.

During this project, I mainly focused on learning how to build a REST API with Python3, Flask and Connexion and connect that REST API to a database using SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow. 

I used Marshmallow to serialize and deserialize Python objects (convert Python class instances to objects that can be converted to JSON).

The code for the web application itself (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) as well as the rest of the code were sourced from https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api-part-4/
